# UMD_Baseball_Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning
Data science and machine learning projects I completed as part of a team for the University of Maryland: College Park D1 Baseball Team.

The Pitcher_Collab file is a program I worked on to automate post-game reports for pitchers on the UMD basbeall team. Our Trackman sensor system would automatically upload a wide array of data to a CSV file. The program would read the CSV and output an informative, clear, and visually appealing report. These reports would be given to the pitchers, managers, and trainers to inform managers on important decisions and help pitchers/trainers know what each pitcher needed to improve upon. I worked on this program primarily with head data analyst for the UMD Baseball Team: Jaron Richman. We adapted some of the basic formatting from a JMU report program.
