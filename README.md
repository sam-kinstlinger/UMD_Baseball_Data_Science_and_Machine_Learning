# UMD_Baseball_Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning
Data science and machine learning projects I completed as part of a team for the University of Maryland: College Park D1 baseball team.

The Pitcher_Collab file is a project I completed with other data scientists and machine learning engineers for the UMD baseball team to automate post-game reports for pitchers on the UMD baseball team. Our Trackman sensor system automatically uploads a wide array of data from each game to a new CSV file. The program reads the CSV file and outputs an informative, clear, and visually appealing report for each pitcher. These reports are given to the pitchers, managers, and trainers to inform managers on important decisions and help pitchers/trainers know what each pitcher needs to improve upon. I worked on this program primarily with head data analyst for the UMD baseball team: Jaron Richman. We adapted some of the basic formatting from a JMU report program. 

The HitPredictor file predicts whether a ball-in-play will be a hit via xgboost. This can help inform possible alterations to training. In this project, I utilized ensemble learning, deep learning, and the treatment/analysis of data imbalances and skew.
